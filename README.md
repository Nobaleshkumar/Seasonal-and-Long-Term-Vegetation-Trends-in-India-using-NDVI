# Seasonal-and-Long-Term-Vegetation-Trends-in-India-using-NDVI
Overview

Analysis of seasonal and long-term vegetation dynamics in India using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) derived from satellite imagery. The project identifies greening/browning trends and seasonal variations across different regions.

Features

Processing multi-temporal remote sensing datasets

GIS-based spatial mapping of vegetation trends

Statistical analysis of seasonal and long-term changes

Correlation with climatic factors for environmental insights
